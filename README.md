ACLS Git Introduction

Important git commands:

* `git status`: Print the current status of all files under
  version control.
* `git add [file-name]`: Put a new file under version control,
  or add changes made to a file to the version control system.
* `git push origin [branch]`: Push the changes made to a branch
  to the project's origin (usually GitHub).
